# Key Distinction Between Modal verb. And Auxiliary verb.

```
so lets focus on modal verb. and auxiliary verb.

I guess the modal verb. currently for OHTER actions or situation but not for me

and the did is for the main actor in the sentence
```

You're getting closer to the heart of the distinction! Let's refine those ideas:

**Modal Verbs (like "could"):**

- **Not Specifically "Other Actions," but Possibility/Ability/Condition:**
    - It's less about "other actions" and more about expressing a _possibility, ability, permission, or obligation_ related to an action.
    - "Could" indicates a potential or a conditional situation. It doesn't necessarily exclude the speaker; it simply frames the action within a context of possibility.
    - Example: "I could go to the store" means I have the ability or the option to go.
    - Modal verbs change the "mood" of the main verb.
- **Context is Key:**
    - The context determines whether the modal verb is about the speaker or someone/something else.
    - "He could run fast" is about his ability.
    - "I could run fast, but I was tired" is about my ability, but a condition stopped the action.

**Auxiliary Verbs (like "did"):**

- **Supporting the Main Verb:**
    - Auxiliary verbs "help" the main verb. They provide grammatical information about tense, aspect, voice, or negation.
    - "Did" specifically forms the past simple tense.
- **Focus on the Subject's Action:**
    - In the simple past tense, "did" (or "didn't") directly relates to the action performed by the subject of the sentence.
    - "I didn't eat" directly states what "I" did not do.
- **Direct Statement of Action:**
    - Auxiliary verbs like "did" are used to create a direct statement about wether or not an action happened.

**Key Distinction:**

- **Modal verbs** change the _meaning_ of the main verb by adding nuances of possibility, ability, etc.
- **Auxiliary verbs** provide _grammatical structure_ to the main verb, particularly regarding tense and negation.

Therefore, your statement is partially correct. Modal verbs do add a layer of context that can be outside of the direct action, and auxiliary verbs do directly support the action of the main subject.
