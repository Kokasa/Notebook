# Diff between could and did
You're right to focus on the roles of "could" and "did" in those phrases. They highlight key grammatical differences:

**"Could" (Modal Verb):**

- **Possibility and Ability:**
    - "Could" is a modal verb, which means it modifies the meaning of another verb. It often expresses possibility, ability, or conditional situations.
    - In "I couldn't enjoy it," "couldn't" indicates a lack of ability or a situation where enjoyment was impossible. It points to a potential that was blocked.
- **Past Possibility:**
    - "Could" is also the past tense of "can," so it can refer to past abilities or possibilities.

**"Did" (Auxiliary Verb):**

- **Past Simple Tense:**
    - "Did" is an auxiliary (helping) verb used to form the past simple tense of other verbs, especially in negative statements and questions.
    - "I didn't enjoy it" uses "didn't" (did not) to directly state that the action of enjoying did not occur in the past. It's a factual statement.
- **Direct Action:**
    - "Did" is used to make a direct statement about an action that either happened or did not happen.

**Here's how this grammatical difference plays out:**

- **"I couldn't enjoy it"**:
    - Emphasizes the _reason_ for the lack of enjoyment.
    - Implies that there were circumstances that prevented the action.
    - Focuses on a lack of ability.
- **"I didn't enjoy it"**:
    - States a simple fact about the past.
    - Doesn't necessarily provide a reason.
    - Focuses on the lack of the action itself.

In essence, "couldn't" deals with potential and ability, while "didn't" deals with the simple occurrence or non-occurrence of an action.
